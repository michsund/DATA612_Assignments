# Module 6 Assignment

I worked with the State Drug Utilization data set again for this assignment.  When deciding where to apply regular expression methods, I noticed by looking at the first few rows of data that the Product Names were not all displayed with the same case format.  I decided to use re.compile determine the format to search for, then used findall to search for Product Names where the name was not in all capital letters like the rest of the names.  I discovered that Kadian Ora is listed with only first letters capitalized, and used the replace function to replace the original product name version with an all capitalized name.  I saved this replaced version as a new column called "Product Name Cleaned".

For the function applications, I chose to make a subset of the data using the "Number of Prescriptions" and "Package Size" columns.  For the mean, I defined a function that divides the sum of the vectors by the size of the vector and returns the result.  For the sum, I only needed to apply a defined sum function to the vectors.  When calculating range, I defined the minimum and maximum value of each vector and had the function return the difference between the two values.  For median and mode, I was able to apply defined .median() or .mode() to achieve the necessary values applied to the vectors in my data subset.
