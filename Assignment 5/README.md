# Module 5 Assignment

I worked with the State Drug Utilization data set again for this assignment on converting data types.  I began by viewing the first few rows for a visual representation of the data I was working with, and used the dtypes function to observe the existing data types in the pandas data frame.  I then looked for a variable that would be appropriate to convert to a categorical data type.  By using the valuecounts() function with the "Utilization Type" variable, I saw that only 2 values are used in all rows, FFSU and MCOU.  Since there was a finite number of options for this variable and they were in text format, I thought the Utilization Type variable would perform well as a categorical data type as well.  I used the astype("category") function to convert the data type, then verified by viewing dtype after execution.  I also chose to convert the Quarter variable to category, since the quarter values represent a range of dates rather than numeric data.  I then chose the "Unnamed: 0" variable to convert to string since it appears to be an ID variable.
