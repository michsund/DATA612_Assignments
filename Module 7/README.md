# Module 7 Assignment

I chose to work with a new dataset for this exercise and used Columbus, OH AirBnB calendar data found at http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html.  I began by modifying the two monetary columns by removing dollar signs, decimal places, and commas to more easily manipulate the columns.  I also added a month column to group the entries by specific months, rather than the original day format.  I then tried a quick groupby test by displaying the sum of the price column, grouped by the dates and listing_ids.  I used the code provided to try to produce a result of the adjusted price subtracted from the price, grouped by date and listing_id where availability was true.  I was unable to get the code to execute, so I tried another method by creating a new column in the data frame where the calculation was located.  I was then able to display the price difference grouped by date and listing_id, and filtered to find prices differences greater than 0, since there were not many instances of price differences occurring.
