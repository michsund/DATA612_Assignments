# Assignment 3: Seaborn Visualizations

I used the State Drug Utilization data set again for this assignment.  Since I wanted to produce simple statistical graphs representing the data, I began by viewing the number of unique values in each column.  I used this view to decide which values to explore and categories to group by, so I wouldn't, for example, produce a bar graph with thousands of categories.

The first graph I produced was a scatterplot with a regression line looking at the Total Amount Reimbursed and the Non-Medicaid Amount Reimbursed.  An intial look at the data gave the impression that the Medicaid Amount Reimbursed typically made up the total.  By plotting the Non-Medicaid amount, I was able to see how often those values occurred and how much of the total they made up.

I then produced a boxplot looking at the prescription package size by quarter.  This plot showed that package size does not seem to vary from quarter to quarter.  I was interested in looking further into the differences between quarters, so I then made a bar graph displaying the total units reimbursed by quarter, which showed the highest number of units reimbursed in Quarter 2 and the lowest number in Quarter 3.
